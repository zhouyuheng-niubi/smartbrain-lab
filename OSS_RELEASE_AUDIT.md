# OSS Release Audit

Project: smartbrain-lab

Prepared on: 2026-06-04

Controls applied:

- Copied to a separate public-release directory.
- Removed VCS history from the source workspace.
- Removed local/private artifacts and generated outputs.
- Redacted known local identifiers, person names, customer/location names, local network addresses, and credential-shaped values.
- Added an anonymized commit author for the public release.

Notes:

- If an upstream license file is present, it is preserved for compliance.
- Absence of a license means the code is published as a source snapshot, not necessarily as a permissively licensed open-source package.
